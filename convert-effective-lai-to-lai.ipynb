    "Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a measure of the total one-sided leaf surface area per unit ground area. It is known to be a proxy for surface aspects that directly influence energy exchange, carbon uptake, and water cycling in ecosystems,  playing a critical role in climate modeling and land surface monitoring. Without exact knowledge of the canopy structure this true LAI is hard to retrieve with optical remtote sensing, leading to the concept of effective LAI. This notebook demonstrates the conversion from effective to true LAI using a clumping factor. It includes the propagation of the uncertainty to the true LAI, including many but not all additional sources of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the difference between effective and true Leaf Area Index, and why conversion may be required for your use case;\n",
    "- Learn how to set up and prepare data for a Leaf Area Index (LAI) conversion algorithm, and then execute the conversion process;\n",
    "- Access and utilize LAI-related data from the Climate Data Store (CDS);\n",
    "- Explore the complexities of LAI conversions and recognize the importance of careful interpretation of results;\n",
    "- Get an impression of the uncertainties involved in the computation of true LAI.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The retrieval of LAI from optical sensors has to make assumptions about the canopy structure, which modifies the signal retrieved by the satellite. Different distributions (clumping) of the same amount of one-sided leaf area per unit ground (the definition of LAI) leads to different optical signals. Some products use a-priori information about the biome type, others, like TIP (used for C3S LAI v2 -- v4 or higher), assume a turbid medium. This is called an effective LAI. Arguably, depending on the degree of realism of the modelled canopy structure, there are differing degrees of effectiveness. The clumping parameter $\\Omega$ (sometimes $\\zeta$) relates true LAI to effective LAI as (cf. [Pinty et al. 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JD005952) or [Fang et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018RG000608)):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\textit{LAI}_\\textit{eff}(\\theta)=\\Omega(\\theta) \\times \\textit{LAI}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The dependence on the solar zenith angle $\\theta$ is included here only for completeness. C3S-TIP LAI is computed for diffuse isotropic illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the application, it may or may not be meaningful to convert effective LAI to true LAI. Here, we use the Land Cover Class (LCC) - specific clumping indices found by [Chen et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2005.05.003) (also available [here](http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Chen/Chen's%20homepage/PDFfiles2/RSE-Chen2005.pdf)) over a period of 8 months (Nov. 1996 -- June 1997) together with the C3S LCC product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation of the true LAI from effective LAI by dividing it with the clumping index may seem trivial, but knowing the correct clumping index is not easy. It actually introduces a number of uncertainties, as there are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. uncertainty of the land cover classification\n",
    "  2. clumping variation within same land cover class (different plant functional types, growth states &c.)\n",
    "  3. seasonal variation of clumping\n",
    "  4. mapping uncertainty between land cover classes\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) is addressed by using the confusion matrix of the C3S LCC product ([C3S LCC v2.1 Product user guide](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/satellite-land-cover?tab=documentation)), also averaging (with probability weights) over the classes. This does, however, not account for temporal LCC changes which have not yet found their way into the LCC product.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) is partly addressed by converting the range of Chen et al.'s clumping indices into an uncertainty by assuming that they define the 97.7%-quantiles, corresponding to 2 sigma of a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) is neglected here, as well as the reported tendencies. Also note, that the clumping parameters of [Chen et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2005.05.003) were not computed over a full year.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) is caused by the somewhat differing classification schemes used by [Chen et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2005.05.003) and C3S LCC. It is partly accounted for by averaging over the corresponding clumping indices where multiple 'Chen'-classes are assigned to one C3S LCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the presented methodology and its results should be interpreted with caution, as it merely demonstrates an approach to investigate the magnitude of the difference and the effects of the sources of uncertainty. A clumping index derived on the basis of plant functional types, including a phenological cycle is expected to give superior results."
